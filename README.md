AutoTabular automates machine learning tasks enabling you to easily achieve strong predictive performance in your applications.  With just a few lines of code, you can train and deploy high-accuracy machine learning and deep learning models tabular data.

## Example

First, install dependencies   
```bash
# clone project   
git clone https://apulis-gitlab.apulis.cn/apulis/AutoTabular/autotabular.git

# install project   
cd autotabular
pip install -e .   
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```   
 Next, navigate to any file and run it.   
 ```bash
# module folder
cd example

# run module (example: mnist as your main contribution)   
python demo.py    
```
